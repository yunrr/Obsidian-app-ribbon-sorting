# Obsidian-app-ribbon-sorting
I am a beginner and not yet familiar with GitHub or how to write JS plugins. I used AI to write a JS plugin for sorting the Obsidian ribbon. The plugin appends the aria-label attribute to the command elements on mobile, enabling the ribbon commands in mobile Obsidian to be sorted via CSS code similar to that on desktop Obsidian. The CSS code is also uploaded together.

Please unzip the zip file to `%your vault%/.obsidian/plugins` and place the CSS file in `%your vault%/.obsidian/snippets`. Then modify the aria-label values in the CSS file to sort the ribbon commands. (Note: The developer has limited programming experience and will add a UI interface to the plugin after learning more about programming.)
